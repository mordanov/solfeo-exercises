# Project status

This document records progress and remaining checks for the current phase.

Prerequisites:
- Read `docs/PHASES.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

Last updated: 2026-09-29 by Copilot, session `1a328640-c756-4c7b-a686-ac6540a9a888`.

## Current phase
PHASE 0.5: Risk prototypes

## Plan for the current phase
- [x] Prepare the OMR sample set and owner-approved evaluation criteria.
- [x] Run Audiveris in Docker and report recognition results.
- [x] Demonstrate protected `.m4a` delivery with X-Accel-Redirect and Range.
- [x] Prepare the prototype deployment plan for owner review.
- [ ] Demonstrate Android PWA sharing over HTTPS.
- [ ] Obtain owner approval of the report and record the final decisions.

## Done
- The owner approves the PHASE 0.5 plan.
- The owner approves 10 initial images, recognition criteria, and an owner-reviewed engine recommendation.
- Local sample preparation uses images 1 through 10; image 11 remains outside the initial evaluation.
- `docs/developer/omr-pipeline.md` defines sample handling, evaluation, and reporting.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` records the approved evaluation criteria and the decision to continue with Audiveris.
- Docker access is restored before the OMR run.
- `prototypes/omr/` contains the pinned Audiveris build, offline runner, settings, dependency lock, and 26 passing tests.
- Ruff and strict mypy pass for the prototype.
- Audiveris `5.11.0` runs natively on ARM64 against all 10 selected images.
- The run exports MusicXML for 9 images; image 6 fails during staff detection.
- The reviewed classification is 8 fully recognized, 0 partly recognized, and 2 failed images.
- Images 8 and 9 meet the threshold but contain notation errors.
- `docs/developer/omr-pipeline.md` contains reproduction commands, per-image results, limitations, and the recommendation.
- The owner confirms the engine recommendation on 2026-09-28.
- Manager review and the original-image fallback remain mandatory.
- The owner confirms completion of the OMR manual checks on 2026-09-28.
- `prototypes/files/` contains the local protected-audio stand and its conversion helper.
- FastAPI authorizes the request; nginx serves the `.m4a` through an internal location.
- All 17 files unit tests and 13 live curl cases pass, with Ruff and strict mypy.
- `docs/developer/protected-audio.md` contains measured Range results and the Safari checklist.
- The files prototype containers and networks stop after verification; local media and evidence remain available.
- The owner confirms completion of the protected-audio manual step on 2026-09-29.
- `docs/developer/pwa-share.md` proposes the static HTTPS prototype and the shared-infrastructure changes.
- The owner approves the static PWA scope and deployment plan on 2026-09-29.
- `prototypes/pwa/` contains the local React/i18n shell, share receiver, IndexedDB storage, manifest, icons, and static Docker image.
- All 28 PWA tests, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and the production build pass.
- Desktop Chrome verifies real multipart navigation, receipt, persistent storage, clear, and explicit errors against the built image.
- nginx rejects unhandled POSTs; browser-handled shares remain on the device.
- The local PWA container and isolated test browser stop after verification.
- The owner confirms the GHCR destination and authorizes shared configuration, publication, and targeted VPS deployment.
- DNS and SSH access identify the existing x86-64 VPS.
- Shared configuration adds the prototype without a database, Redis, or landing-page link.
- A prototype-only workflow validates and publishes the x86-64 image without automatic VPS deployment.
- The publishing workflow succeeds for application commit `8efc058`.
- The VPS runs the published image by digest at `https://solfeo.miveralta.ru/prototype-share/`.
- Shared infrastructure commits `900f62e` and `4578b73` persist on `main` and the VPS.
- A one-time `[skip ci]` synchronization prevents the general shared deployment from restarting unrelated applications.
- The hostname certificate is valid; the existing certificate watcher activates HTTPS.
- All 17 public HTTP checks pass, including certificate validation, manifest icons, worker headers, and early POST rejection.
- Desktop Chrome verifies the public share flow, persistence, clearing, and manifest installability without errors.
- All 12 deployed static files match the locally validated build.
- All 41 unrelated containers retain their original IDs and start times.
- `docs/user/pwa-prototype.md` provides the Android acceptance procedure.
- The owner approves the diagnostic follow-up after failed Android acceptance.
- The prototype maps text, title, and URL fields and distinguishes text-only, empty, and unexpected file-field input.
- On-device diagnostics retain field categories, file counts, types, and sizes without message contents, links, or filenames.
- Diagnostics and the last successful file have separate storage and clear actions.
- All 41 prototype tests, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, and the production build pass locally and in GitHub Actions.
- Diagnostic source commit `d171be5` is published and deployed by digest.
- Public HTTPS verifies the new manifest mappings and privacy-safe diagnostics through real browser form submissions.
- Failed attempts preserve the last successful file; diagnostic clearing persists independently.
- All 42 other containers, including nginx, retain their IDs and start times during this update.

## In progress
- The files protocol checks and owner manual step are complete.
- Basic authentication is a localhost-only prototype assumption, not a product authentication decision.
- The HTTPS deployment works, but Android messenger sharing fails owner acceptance.
- On 2026-09-29, the owner reports "No audio file was received" after sharing from Telegram or WhatsApp.
- The owner repeats the Android test and reports a current attempt timestamp, `EMPTY_SHARE`, 0 file fields, and no form fields.
- The receiver observes an empty form; the point where data disappears remains unknown.
- Message-only sharing remains an unconfirmed hypothesis.
- The owner proposes a Telegram bot as an alternative ingestion path; implementation and product changes are not approved.

## Next step
- Review the proposed Telegram bot risk prototype in `docs/developer/pwa-share.md`.
- Keep PWA acceptance failed; do not replace the product share requirement without owner approval.
- Retain the file-manager control test as an optional way to isolate the Android sharing failure.

## Open questions for the owner
- Identify the Android device and browser versions when manual testing starts.

## Manual checks the owner must do
- [x] Confirm that images 1 through 10 represent the intended exercises.
- [x] Review the criteria in `docs/developer/omr-pipeline.md`.
- [x] Review the local MusicXML against the original images, especially images 7–9.
- [x] Review the image 6 failure and the manual event counts.
- [x] Confirm the recommendation to continue with Audiveris.
- [x] Complete the protected-audio manual step, as confirmed by the owner.
- [ ] Reinstall the deployed PWA from Android Chrome and confirm the `diagnostics v1` section.
- [ ] Share audio from WhatsApp and Telegram to the installed PWA.
- [ ] Verify receipt details, reload persistence, clearing, and sharing after closing the PWA.

## Known issues
- Image 6 produces no MusicXML; image 7 receives 46 % recognition.
- Images 8 and 9 receive 95.35 % and 88 %, with important errors despite their `fully recognized` labels.
- Local artifacts are under `prototypes/omr/output/20260928T201957Z-84f49a71/`.
- Files evidence is under `prototypes/files/output/curl-20260928T204244Z-ec7ed479/`.
- The owner reports completion of the files manual step; device versions and the test setup are not recorded.
- Basic authentication uses disposable local credentials; product session authentication remains out of scope.
- The files prototype image remains local; operating-system package repositories remain unpinned.
- The PWA keeps only the latest successful share and rejects files above 25 MiB by default.
- Desktop browser checks do not establish Android sharing compatibility.
- The owner reports failed Android messenger sharing; successful desktop checks do not override this result.
- The original receiver cannot distinguish message-only input; the diagnostic update requires a refreshed PWA installation.
- PWA browser and static-server evidence remain in `prototypes/pwa/output/`.
- Samples and generated MusicXML remain local; a fresh clone does not contain them.
- The HTTPS PWA runs at `https://solfeo.miveralta.ru/prototype-share/`.
- The onboarding guide is `../web-projects/web-folders/documentation/onboarding.md`.
- PHASE 0.5 remains incomplete until the remaining prototypes and owner review finish.
